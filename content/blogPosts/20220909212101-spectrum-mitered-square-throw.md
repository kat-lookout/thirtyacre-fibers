OK, I admit it. I have a thing for mitered squares. I first learned about them when I made a [Hue Shift Afghan](https://www.knitpicks.com/hue-shift-afghan/p/41112D), many moons ago. I enjoyed the project so much I made a second one for my niece!

The inspiration for this particular throw came from several places. I had been making 7" x 9" blanket sections for [Warm Up America](http://www.warmupamerica.org), and I kept trying to come up with a way to make a 7" x 9" mitered square, but couldn't think of one. Instead, I thought I'd try making an 35" x 45" lapghan to send. With 5" squares, that worked out nicely into 7 rows of 9 squares each, and 7 rows fit very nicely with the 7 colors of the rainbow (the visible spectrum, hence the project name).

I never did mail it off to Warm Up America, but I did donate it to help supply an immigrant family from  Venezuela that my church is sponsoring!
