This is my second Diamond Rain Shawl. I love how the inspiration for the pattern, [the diamond rain that likely exists on Neptune](https://www.space.com/diamond-rain-atmosphere-uranus-neptune), pairs so nicely with the deep space NASA image inspiration for the yarn colorway.

For those looking closely, you'll see that the last inch or so of the shawl appears to be a slightly different colorway then the rest of the shawl. This is because I misjudged the amount of yarn I would need, and didn't order enough! The next skein came from a different dye batch that had stronger black and purple tones then the first two skeins. Blocking evened it out a little bit, but I think it still looks awesome! Note to self for the future: always buy at least one skein *more* yarn than you think you need!
